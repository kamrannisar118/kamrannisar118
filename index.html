    <h1>Muhammad Kamran Nisar (Cheena)</h1>
    <p>Muhammad Kamran Nisar aka Cheena was born in 2005, in the suburbs of Lahore, Pakistan, in the town of Sharaqpur. He belongs to the "Cheena" faction of the Jatt tribe of the Punjab. His hometown is famous for its special dish: <em>the
        gulab-jamuns.</em> And so the resemblance can be found between his traits and the dish: the sweeter, the blacker.</p>
    <p>Like any other individual, his life started as an ordinary soul, but he had an ambition and burning desire to achieve his ambition. This will also be discussed here but let's start from the very beginning of the story.</p>

<h2><center>Beginning years</h2></center>

<p>The sources are not sure about how the plot took place in the start of a legend, but limited evidence suggests that the following events have confirmed their occurance in the life of the legend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never watched cartoons.</li>
  <li>Not interested in any kind of physical sport.</li>
  <li>Not even interested in mobile games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, as an ordinary mind, the all of you will be knitting different reasons for these limited facts (only 1% mentioned), but the reality is what you don't see. As mentioned in the first paragraph of the article, there was an ambition and most
  importantly, there was a burning desire to achieve that ambition.</p>

  <h2>Primary Education</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Muhammad Kamran Cheena got educated in a Govt. school situated in his village. As soon as he completed his primary school, his family moved to Sharaqpur for better opportunities of life. There, he got admission in one of the finest
  institutions of that time and continued his studies.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was a bit of problem in understanding the national language that was mainly spoken in the school in comparison to his mother language (Note: Mother language of Cheena is <b><em>Punjabi</em></b>).</p>
<p>However, life continued and he progressed continuously, although some distractions also occured in his life due to co-classes but he took over them and focused on his main goal.</p>
<p>Kamran, as a teen, wanted to go to the army and he was ready for it, but nature had its own plans. He was rejected in army tests twice due to a couple of <em>physical reasons</em>, but at last got selected and started preparing to depart from his
  town. But he was destined to do something else, and so he didn't go to the college and changed his mind the night before departure.</p>
